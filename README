=head1 NAME

AutoReloader - Reload %INC files when updated on disk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  AutoReloader->check;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When Perl pulls a file via C<require>, it stores the filename in the
global hash C<%INC>.  The next time Perl tries to C<require> the same
file, it sees the file in C<%INC> and does not reload from disk.  This
module's handler iterates over C<%INC> and reloads the file if it has
changed on disk. 

Set $AutoReloader::Debug to enable debugging output.

=head1 DIRECTION

It is expected that this will be included in the main perl
distribution shortly.
